| Technologies | Use Cases
--------------|---------------------------------|
| Angular | I have been wanting to learn Angular for a while now, and I think that this would be a great way to learn it. |
Gemini API| I have been wanting to learn how to use different AI APIs, and I think that this would be a great way to learn it. 
Flutter| I want to do mobile app development, and I think this would be a great way to transition
Spring Boot|This is a popular Java framwork for businesses, and I need to adapt
SASS| I can already use this, but I would like to get better at it, in order to increase my CSS skills
AWS|I have only dabble in this, and would like to get better at it. Also, many businesses require atleast some knowledge of AWS
Three.js|I want to create a great 3D website, and I think this would be a great way to do it
SQL|I want to create a database, and I think this would be a great way to do it. Especially since so many businesses use SQL
NoSQL | I want an alternative to SQL
Clerk/OAuth| I want to do authentication and as I want i to be secure, this would be a great middleware
React| I already have experience with this, but I think creating more projects with this uber popular framework can't hurt
More RESTful APIs| I do have one project using this, but would like to make an app where someone else can use an api that I have created.
Go | I want to create a fullstack app with a Go backend, it just feels like it would be fun.


Websites that I already have:
I already have experience with using APIs, and that can be found here (*private project*) but this is not being used for any real purpose and really is just a demo website, so I want to create a better one.
For that projects I learned about how to use dynamic URL parameters as well as api calls, creating a search bar, caching, and how to use the API in a real project.
Description of Project: A website where you can type in the url spot a pokemon name or id and see a card with the pokemon's name, id, image, and type. You can also search for a pokemon by name or compare them using a "_" in the url. There is also a "Pokemon Finder" where you can search by name. The website is also mobile friendly. **If you would like to see the code for this project, please contact me.**
